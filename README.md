# NAME

Locale::Places - Translate places between different languages using http://download.geonames.org/

# VERSION

Version 0.14

# SYNOPSIS

Translates places between different languages, for example
London is Londres in French.

# METHODS

## new

Create a Locale::Places object.

Takes one optional parameter, directory,
which tells the object where to find a directory called 'data' containing GB.sql and US.sql
If that parameter isn't given,
the module will attempt to find the databases,
but that can't be guaranteed.
Any other options are passed to the underlying database driver.

## translate

Translate a city into a different language.

Parameters:
\- place (mandatory): The name of the place to translate.
\- from: The source language (optional; defaults to environment language).
\- to: The target language (mandatory).
\- country: The country where the place is located (optional; defaults to 'GB').

Returns:
\- Translated name if found, or undef if no translation exists.

Example:
    use Locale::Places;

    # Prints "Douvres"
    print Locale::Places->new()->translate({ place => 'Dover', country => 'GB', from => 'en', to => 'fr' });

## AUTOLOAD

Translate to the given language, where the routine's name will be the target language.

    # Prints 'Virginie', since that's Virginia in French
    print $places->fr({ place => 'Virginia', from => 'en', country => 'US' });

# BUGS

Only supports places in GB and US at the moment.

Canterbury no longer translates to Cantorb√©ry in French.
This is a problem with the data, which has this line:

    16324587    2653877 fr      Canterbury      1

which overrides the translation by setting the 'isPreferredName' flag

Can't specify below country level.
For example, is Virginia a state or a town in Illinois or one in Minnesota?
